============
This final project was about creating a modular cord organizer for my computer charger, phone charger, and tablet charger. Currently the main problem is figuring out a design that will accomicate all shapes of boxes/plugs to make a modular design make sense. Plus the computer charger has two sets of cords, while the tablet and phone charger just have the cord and the adaptor. Work In progress currently.
